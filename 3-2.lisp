; Write a version of union that preserves the order of the elements in the original lists:
; > (new-union '(a b c) '(b a d))
; (A B C D)
; 
; (I'm assuming PG means the order of the first list/argument)

(defun new-union (list-a list-b)
; foreach element in list-a
; if that element exists in list-b, take it out of list-b




(new-union '(a b c) '(b a d))
